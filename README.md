## Description
In this project, we focus on segmenting roads in Massachusetts using a deep learning approach. The goal is to accurately identify and segment roads from satellite images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at [Massachusetts Roads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/massachusetts-roads-dataset/code). It consists of satellite images of Massachusetts roads for training and evaluation.

## RoadSegmentation.ipynb
The `RoadSegmentation.ipynb` file contains all the necessary steps and code to perform road segmentation on the provided dataset. Follow the instructions in the notebook to replicate the results.

## Metrics
The performance of the road segmentation model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- Intersection over Union (IoU)

## Results
After training on test data, I got the following results:
Precision ~ 87.4%

Recall ~ 63.6%

IoU ~ 58.4%
