## Description
In this project, we focus on segmenting roads in Massachusetts using a deep learning approach. The goal is to accurately identify and segment roads from satellite images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at [Massachusetts Roads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/massachusetts-roads-dataset/code). It consists of satellite images of Massachusetts roads for training and evaluation.

## RoadSegmentation.ipynb
The `RoadSegmentation.ipynb` file contains all the necessary steps and code to perform road segmentation on the provided dataset. Follow the instructions in the notebook to replicate the results.

## Metrics
The performance of the road segmentation model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- Intersection over Union (IoU)

## Results
After training and evaluating the model, the results will be presented in the notebook along with insights and analysis of the road segmentation task.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the dataset to improve the road segmentation accuracy. Let's enhance the mapping of Massachusetts roads together!
